# Ecommerce-Platform

âœ… Project Summary:
Developed and maintained a robust and scalable RESTful API to support core functionalities such as product browsing, cart management, checkout, and user authentication for a high-traffic e-commerce platform.
# ðŸ”§ Key Contributions:
### Designed Scalable Endpoints
Defined clean RESTful routes adhering to proper HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
Ensured resource-based URL design (/products, /orders, /users/:id/cart).

### Performance Optimization

Introduced caching using Redis for frequently accessed data like product listings and categories, significantly reducing database load.
Implemented pagination and lazy loading for product search and browse endpoints.
Used asynchronous processing (e.g., background jobs for order confirmation emails) to offload heavy tasks.

### Database Tuning

Optimized queries using indexes and reduced N+1 query problems with joins and fetch strategies (if using ORM like Hibernate/JPA).

### Monitoring and Logging

Integrated tools like New Relic, ELK Stack, or Prometheus + Grafana to monitor API latency, traffic, and error rates.
Set up alerts for API slowdowns or failures.

### Security Enhancements

Enforced authentication via JWT or OAuth 2.0.
Rate-limited sensitive endpoints to prevent abuse.
Validated input data rigorously to prevent injection attacks.

### Load Testing and Benchmarking

Used tools like Apache JMeter, k6, or Postman to simulate high traffic and identify bottlenecks.
Refactored bottlenecks leading to a 25% improvement in average response time.

### High Availability and Scaling

Deployed API behind a load balancer (like NGINX or AWS ELB).
Enabled horizontal scaling via container orchestration (Docker + Kubernetes or ECS).
